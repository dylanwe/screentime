# 🎬 Screen-Time
I had planned this for some time reworking one of my older [sites]([http://dylanwe.com/webroot/screentime/index.php](http://dylanwe.com/webroot/screentime/index.php)) for viewing movie information. I wanted to change a couple of things and try React.
## 👨‍💻 How I made it

For this project I planned on working with React.js because I felt that components could help me a lot in managing and reusing code. The slider is a Slick slider React component that works great and gave me the desired result. I also wanted TV shows to work on this, and so I rewrote my slider component so it would support that.
  
## 👨‍🏫 What I learned
- [x] A ton of React: `Components` `react-router` `props` and `JSX`
- [x] GitHub pages
  
## 📌 What I would do different
- The linking to different pages is awful. The reason for this is that the `React router` Link component doesn't differentiate between a drag and a click making the slider useless. If I had to redo this website I would definitely look more into that problem.
- I have a bad understanding of states, so I would like to learn more about that.
